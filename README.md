# 📈 Stock Market Analysis & Prediction using LSTM

This project uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to analyze and predict stock prices of major companies such as Tesla (TSLA), Nvidia (NVDA), and Netflix (NFLX).

The models are trained on historical data and saved along with their corresponding scalers for real-time predictions.

## 🧠 Features
- LSTM-based prediction model
- Company-specific analysis
- Visual trend plotting
- Simple and interactive interface via Streamlit
